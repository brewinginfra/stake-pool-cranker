# Stake Pool Cranker

</div>


A Rust-based automation tool for cranking [Stake Pool](https://spl.solana.com/stake-pool/cli) pools on the Solana blockchain using a CLI interface. It is designed to simplify and automate the process of sending cranking transactions using Solana RPC and a designated wallet.

---

## 🧪 Requirements

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Solana CLI (for local key management, optional)

---

## 🔧 Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file or export the following environment variables:

```env
RPC_URL="https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
FEE_PAYER_PRIVATE_KEY=''  # Your Solana wallet's private key (Base64 or JSON)
STAKE_POOL_ADDRESS=''     # Your Stake Pool address
SLACK_TOKEN=''            # Slack Bot Token
SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=''       # Slack channel id where bot should send the message
```

<!-- ```` -->

> ⚠️ **Do not expose your `FEE_PAYER_PRIVATE_KEY` in public repos.** Use secrets managers or environment variables for secure deployment.

> **Do not forget to change the message that you want to send on your slack channel. To change the message update line no. 81 in main.rs**
